# war
A coding challenge after the card game "War"

 /**
 * Problem 3
 *
 * Allotted time: 30 minutes
 *
 * In JavaScript, design and write the code for a deck of cards that can be used
 * to play a game of War. Focus on the JS; no visuals are necessary. Please
 * approach this problem in an object-oriented fashion. What kinds of classes
 * are necessary? How do they interact? How would a game of War be played
 * using these classes?
 * 
 * It's OK if you run out of time on this problem. Be prepared to explain your
 * thought process and discuss anything you don't have time to finish.
